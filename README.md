# RealTime-Parking-Space-Counter-System
This project is a real-time parking space counter. It uses OpenCV to process video footage of a parking lot, detecting and classifying parking spots as either occupied or empty. The system compares the current video frame with the previous frame to determine changes, and labels each parking spot on the video feed with its status. It also calculates and displays the total number of available parking spots
